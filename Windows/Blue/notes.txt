# Initial nmap scans
Initial nmap scanning shows that the common SMB ports are open (445,139)
Given that nmap was able to determine that the machine is a Windows 7 box, it may
be vulnerable to MS17-010(EternalBlue)

Follow-up nmap scanning to check for eternal blue vulnerability via nmap nse
script determines that box IS vulnerable to EB

# Exploiting EB withough Metasploit
Challenging myself to exploit machines as much as possible without metasploit
may have to use msfvenom here and there for shellcode though

started with ExploitDB 42315.py for eternal blue exploit
copy mysmb.py from github https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py

42315 did not find accessible named pipe on initial run

trying 42031.py (also from exploitDB)
created required shellcode using msfvenom

after attempts to exploit with exploit db payloads failed use github repos
https://github.com/REPTILEHAUS/Eternal-Blue

Noticed that the github exploit works due to x64 bit shellcode vs x86, which is
what I was using in the 42315.py attempts. 

The shell granted via exploit is for `NT Authority/System` meaning we already have
root access
