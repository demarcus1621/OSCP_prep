### 1.0 HackTheBox: Legacy OSCP Practice Report
#### 1.1 Executive Summary
I was tasked with solving the _Legacy_ machine from _HackTheBox_. Solving
this machine involves retrieving the contents of two files found on the
system and reporting said contents to the _HackTheBox_ website. The focus
of these efforts is to solve machines found on a list by Twitter user `@TJ_Null`
in order to practice for the _Offensive Security: Penetration Testing with Kali_
course OSCP exam. My overall focus was to ensure that I am able to perform proper
techniques to sovle the listed machines whilst properly taking notes and writing
a report.

When solving the _Legacy_ machine, there were a few noteworthy things identified,
thus allowing me to solve the machine. While performing attacks I was able to gain
access to the machine and elevate to root privileges. This is primarily due to poor
permissions practices and security configurations. This machine was successfully
exploited and I was able to achieve super user privileges.
