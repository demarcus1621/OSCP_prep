# Nmap
Initial Nmap scans alert of port 80 being open
* Apache 2.4.18 Likely Ubuntu Xenial

# Webapp
Running Gobuster on webserver listening on port 80 with wordlist
 - `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

Found `/dev/` subdirectory, which contains file `phpbash.php`, which
is a webshell.

The phpbash Github notes that there is a custom upload command. This
could be a potential vector we can use to upload a reverse shell.

Custom upload command did not work as expected. Wget is installed on
machine, so I will use wget to upload a reverse shell.

Bash reverse shell upload successful via wget into `/tmp/.hidden`

# Reverse Shell (www-data)
As www-data the home directory of user Arraxel is readable thus, user flag
is obtained. To escalate priveleges, I will run the LinPeas tool

# LinPEAS [www-data]
Found that user `www-data` has sudo priveleges w/ no password as the
user `scriptmanager`.

Found `/scripts` directory in `/`

# Elevate to scriptmanager
`sudo -i -u scriptmanager`
The `/scripts` directory, which was found by linPEAS is owned by scriptmanager

The txt file `test.txt` in the `/scripts` directory is owned by root, but has the
contents of the output of the python program in the `/scripts` directory, which is
owned by scriptmanager.
attempting to append python reverse shell into the python script in `/scripts` dir

# Root reverse shell
There MUST be a cron job that runs the vulnerable python script regularly, as no
extra effort was needed after appending malicious code into the vulnerable script

Retrieve root flag
